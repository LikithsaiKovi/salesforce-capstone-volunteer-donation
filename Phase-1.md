# Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

## 1. Requirement Gathering
- Volunteers should be registered with name, email, phone, and skills.
- Donations should be recorded with amount, donor, and linked volunteer (if any).
- Tasks should be created for volunteers (e.g., event support, training).
- Coordinators should get notifications for large donations.
- Reports needed: Volunteer activity, Donations by month, Top donors.

## 2. Stakeholder Analysis
- **Volunteer Coordinator** → Manages volunteers & assigns tasks.  
- **Finance Officer** → Tracks and approves donations.  
- **Volunteers** → Can see and update their own tasks.  
- **Admin** → Maintains Salesforce system.  

## 3. Business Process Mapping
**Process Flow Example:**
Volunteer signs up → System auto-assigns “Orientation Task” → Coordinator assigns event tasks → Donations recorded → Reports generated.

## 4. Industry-specific Use Case
Non-profit organizations require:
- Transparent donation reporting
- Efficient volunteer engagement
- Event/task management  

## 5. AppExchange Exploration
Salesforce provides the **Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP)** on AppExchange, but in this project we will **build a simplified custom solution** for learning purposes.
