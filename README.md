# Problem Statement

A Non-Profit Organization (Helping Hands Foundation) needs a Salesforce-based system to streamline volunteer management and donation tracking.  
Currently, volunteer onboarding and donation records are handled manually in spreadsheets, leading to inefficiency, duplicate entries, and lack of transparency.  

The system should:
- Manage volunteer details (skills, availability, contact info).  
- Track donations linked to donors/volunteers.  
- Automate volunteer onboarding (assign orientation task).  
- Generate reports on donations and volunteer activities.  
- Provide dashboards for transparency and decision-making.  

This project will be implemented in Salesforce using both **Admin** (configuration & automation) and **Developer** (Apex & LWC) capabilities, following a structured 10-phase implementation process.
